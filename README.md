# JSON Basics 

## Definition of JSON:
- JavaScript Object Notation
---> is usually a **dictionary**
- However, confusingly also an object in JS in the Data Type for both Lists (Arrays) and Dictionaries (Hash)

## Why is JS important
- Only language that is not a markup language.  

## Create a JSON File and JSON Strings

###  json.dumps(obj) --> string json

### json.dump(obj) --> writes json in file

## Make POST Request with JSON
- you need
    - path
    - json
    - headers

## Postcode_return_task

````
> 1 - Postcode: xyzpto with nhs location at: xyz
> 2 - Postcode: xyzpto2 with nhs location at: xyz
> 3 - (....)
